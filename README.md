## 📖 Introduction

This is a Software as a Service starter kit. Made with [Blitz](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz). Inspired by [Wave](https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave) and [BulletTrain](bullettrain.co). Designed using DDD as described [here](https://zenn.dev/repomn/articles/2ecaebd9ef6bfa).

## How the project works?

### Folder structure

The folder structure is very similar to a normal blitz app, except for the app folder structure

```bash
app
├── api # For the api routes
├── contract # For types
├── core # For shared logic that isn't specific to a module
├── modules # For domain modules
├── pages # For the app pages
├── services # For modules that don't have a  model
└── start # To files that will be loaded only once on the app boot

```

## Running the project

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Installation

First, you will need to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/arthur-er/blitz-sass.git project_name
```

Then follow these 3 steps:

#### **1. Copy the `.env.example` file**

Duplicate the file and rename it to .env.local, then replace the DATABASE_URL, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB with the correct data for your project

#### **2. Install the dependencies**

Simply run

```bash
$ yarn
```

#### **2. Run the migrations and seeds**

Simply run

```bash
$ yarn blitz prisma migrate dev
$ yarn blitz db seed
```

#### **3. Start the dev server**

Simply run

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

🎉 And that's it! You will now be able to visit your app at http://localhost:3000 and see your application up and running.
